# django-recipes-api
A Django REST API. Built for future reference.

I really liked Django when I use it, and I miss it these days. I've been working mostly with an Express server on the back end. I like how un-opinionated it is, but there's a lot to be said for being able to get an API up and running even quicker than Express may let us. Just testing it out now.

The idea of a React front end on top of Django sounds appealing to me! Let's see how it goes.
